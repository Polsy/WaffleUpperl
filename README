Usable on whichever perl-supporting OS you enjoy, but aimed at non-Windows
platforms where RightLoad and other such applications do not exist.

Syntax: wafflelinux.pl [imageFile]... 

Running the script as above will produce a list of BBcode [img] tags
containing the WaffleImages URL for each image that supplied.
